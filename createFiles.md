# Terminal

A terminal is a text input and output environment. it is a program that acts as a window that allows you to enter commands that the computer processes.

# Basic Commands for Creating Files

* **mkdir**: `mkdir` is short for *"make directory"* and passing this command will create a new directory with the name of your choice.

***Example:***
```C
mkdir fruit
```

* **cd**: `cd` is short for *"Change directory"* and passing this command takes you from your current directory into another of your choice.

***Example***:
```C
cd fruit
```

* **touch**: `touch` is a command that, when passed, allows you to create a new file in your current directory. This file will also be given the name of your choice.

***Example***:
```C
touch apple
```

>Tip: to create more than one file at a time, seperate the file names with a space` `to tell the terminal the following name entered is a seperate file

***Example***:
```C
touch apple orange banana
```
